// Wire shape mirrors `GET /api/v1/auth/me` (§12) and the passkey
// ceremony endpoints (§03 "WebAuthn specifics", §"Login"). The
// production server is in flight; these shapes are the contract the
// SPA depends on and will move into `@/types/auth.ts` once §12 lands
// the response schema there. Keeping them local for now means the
// auth module can compile and unit-test without blocking on the
// upstream PR.

/**
 * Minimal "who is logged in" envelope returned by
 * `GET /api/v1/auth/me`. The bare-host variant of `/me` is identity-
 * only (no workspace context) — we can't return the full `Me`
 * because the caller may not have picked a workspace yet.
 *
 * Property notes:
 * - `user_id`: the canonical ULID of the authenticated user. Stable
 *   across email changes and grant churn.
 * - `display_name` / `email`: surfaced in the user menu so the chrome
 *   doesn't need a second fetch before paint.
 * - `available_workspaces`: drives `<WorkspaceGate>` and the
 *   `/select-workspace` page (§14) without a follow-up to
 *   `/me/workspaces`. May be empty for a brand-new account whose
 *   first grant invitation is still pending — that case lands on the
 *   "no workspaces yet" empty state.
 * - `current_workspace_id`: the slug the **server** thinks is active
 *   (read from the `crewday_workspace` cookie). When present and the
 *   client hasn't picked one yet, `<WorkspaceGate>` adopts it
 *   silently.
