"""SQLAlchemy models for the LLM / agent layer (cd-cm5).

Defines the five workspace-scoped tables that back §11's agent and
LLM plumbing from the DB side:

* :class:`ModelAssignment` — capability → model map, one row per
  ``(workspace_id, capability)`` pair.
* :class:`AgentToken` — delegated agent tokens (one row per minted
  token). ``hash`` stores the **sha256** digest of the plaintext
  token; ``prefix`` carries the first 6-8 chars of the plaintext so
  the ``/me/tokens`` listing can disambiguate without revealing the
  secret. The service layer does the hashing — this module is DB
  only.
* :class:`ApprovalRequest` — human-in-the-loop agent-action
  approval queue. ``action_json`` is a JSON blob (pydantic-validated
  at the service layer).
* :class:`LlmUsage` — per-call usage ledger (tokens, cost, latency,
  status, correlation id).
* :class:`BudgetLedger` — rolling-period spend ledger (one row per
  ``(workspace_id, period_start, period_end)``).

The spec (§02 "LLM" and §11) lands a richer normalised model in a
later slice (``llm_provider`` / ``llm_model`` / ``llm_provider_model``
/ ``llm_assignment`` / ``llm_call`` / ``llm_usage_daily`` / etc.) —
this cd-cm5 v1 slice is the minimum-viable workspace-scoped shape
that covers the five columns the Beads task pins. The richer surface
lands via follow-up migrations without breaking this slice's write
contract.

``model_id`` is a plain :class:`~sqlalchemy.String` **soft
reference** — the ``llm_model`` deployment-scope registry has not
yet landed, so declaring a FK now would break the migration timeline
once that table appears. The column holds the ULID that identifies
the model; the service layer resolves it at call time.

FK hygiene (see the package ``__init__`` docstring for the full
rationale):

* ``workspace_id`` CASCADE on every row — sweeping a workspace
  sweeps its agent configuration.
* ``delegating_user_id`` / ``decided_by`` / ``requester_actor_id``
  SET NULL — history survives a user hard-delete; the audit trail
  ships with the denormalised identity columns downstream code
  depends on.

# * ``refused`` — the provider emitted an explicit content-refusal
#   (``finish_reason = safety`` / equivalent) **or** our own budget
#   envelope refused the call pre-flight. The §11 budget-refused
#   path still writes a ledger row (the spec lets refusals skip
#   ``llm_call`` — this slice keeps them for audit telemetry).

class ModelAssignment(Base):
    """Capability → model binding for a workspace.

    A capability may carry **many** assignments, forming a priority-
    ordered fallback chain — the §11 resolver walks the chain on
    retryable failures (provider 5xx, 429, timeout, provider content
    refusal, transport error). Lower ``priority`` is tried first; 0 is
    the primary. The cd-cm5 v1 slice pinned one row per
    ``(workspace_id, capability)``; cd-u84y replaces that with the
    composite ``(workspace_id, capability, priority)`` shape the
    §11-pinned resolver and the v1 `LLMAssignment` API surface both
    depend on.

    Reassigning the primary is an UPDATE on the ``priority=0`` row (or
    an insert-then-reorder through the bulk reorder API); deletion
    reverts the capability to the deployment-level default pulled from
    the §11 assignment chain and, failing that, the inheritance parent
    in :class:`LlmCapabilityInheritance`.

    ``capability`` is a plain :class:`~sqlalchemy.String` because
    the §11 capability catalogue (``receipt_ocr``, ``nl_task_intake``,
    ``daily_digest``, ``staff_chat``, …) is a closed enum in code but
    grows over time; widening it as a CHECK body would force a
    migration on every capability addition. The service layer
    narrows the string to a :class:`Literal` on read.

    ``provider`` carries the provider name that serves this
    assignment (``openrouter``, ``openai_compatible``, ``fake``, …) —
    denormalised off the spec's ``llm_provider`` registry so a
    readout of the workspace's assignments does not need to join
    back through the deployment-scope provider table (which lands in
    a later slice).

    ``model_id`` is a **soft reference** — plain :class:`String(26)`
    carrying the ULID that identifies the ``llm_model`` row the
    service layer resolves at call time. A FK is deferred until the
    deployment-scope ``llm_model`` table lands so the migration
    timeline does not break.

    Per-call tuning columns (``max_tokens`` / ``temperature`` /
    ``extra_api_params``) match the spec's ``llm_assignment`` shape
    (§11 "Model assignment"). ``max_tokens`` / ``temperature`` are
    nullable so a NULL means "inherit the model default";
    ``extra_api_params`` is a JSON blob the adapter merges last over
    the provider-model defaults.

    ``required_capabilities`` is a JSON list copied from the §11
    capability catalogue entry on save — the admin UI warns when an
    operator binds a model that lacks a required sub-capability
    (``vision``, ``json_mode``, …). Empty list = no constraints.

    ``enabled`` lets an operator hold an assignment in the chain
    without activating it; the §11 resolver skips disabled rows. When
    every assignment for a capability is disabled, the resolver falls
    through to :class:`LlmCapabilityInheritance` and then raises
    ``CapabilityUnassignedError`` (§11 "Capability inheritance").

    * ``fallback_attempts`` — how many prior rungs failed before
      this one succeeded. 0 = first-rung success. Matches §11
      "LLMResult" ``fallback_attempts`` contract.
    * ``finish_reason`` — the provider's free-form finish reason
      (``stop`` / ``length`` / ``content_filter`` / ``tool_calls`` /
      …). NULL for timeout / transport-error rows that never
      produced a body. Plain string — providers ship different
      vocabularies.
    * ``actor_user_id`` — the delegating user (§11 "Agent audit
      trail"). NULL for service-initiated calls (digest worker,
      health check). Soft reference — no FK so a user hard-delete
      preserves the trail.

    Matches §11's "Workspace usage budget" envelope: a single row
    per ``(workspace_id, period_start, period_end)`` tuple carrying
    the period's accumulated ``spent_cents`` against its configured
    ``cap_cents``. The worker refreshes ``spent_cents`` every 60 s
    from the aggregated :class:`LlmUsage` rows in the window; the
    pre-flight check reads the cached aggregate before deciding
    whether the next call fits under ``cap_cents``.

    Storing cents (not dollars) sidesteps decimal / rounding hazards
    across SQLite + PG — :class:`Integer` is portable and exact;
    the spec's ``numeric(8,4)`` cap maps onto cents without loss
    (5.0000 USD ↔ 500 cents).

    ``period_start`` / ``period_end`` bound the rolling window. A
    rolling-30d implementation pins ``period_end - period_start = 30
    days``; a calendar-month implementation pins month boundaries.
    The unique index on the triple prevents two ledger rows from
    overlapping the same period.
