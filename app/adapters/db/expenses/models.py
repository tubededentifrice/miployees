"""ExpenseClaim / ExpenseLine / ExpenseAttachment SQLAlchemy models.

v1 slice per cd-lbn — sufficient for the claim CRUD (cd-7rfu) and the
``expenses.autofill`` LLM capability (§11) follow-ups to layer
business rules on top. The richer §09 surface (payout-destination
snapshots computed at approval, ``exchange_rate`` cross-rate cache,
``expense_line.asset_id`` link into §21 asset TCO, ``pages`` per
attachment, ``edited_by_user`` provenance bit, ``autofill_confidence_overall``
derivation) lands with those follow-ups without breaking this
migration's public write contract.

Every table carries a ``workspace_id`` column and is registered as
workspace-scoped via the package's ``__init__``. FK hygiene mirrors
the rest of the app:

* ``workspace_id`` cascades on delete — sweeping a workspace sweeps
  its expense history (the §15 tombstone / export worker snapshots
  first).
* ``work_engagement_id`` on :class:`ExpenseClaim` uses ``RESTRICT`` —
  a claim is the payroll-law evidence for a reimbursement (§09
  §"Expense claims", §15 §"Right to erasure"); archiving the
  engagement must not silently drop claim history. The normal
  archive path is ``work_engagement.archived_on``, not a hard
  DELETE.
* ``claim_id`` on :class:`ExpenseLine` and :class:`ExpenseAttachment`
  cascades — deleting a claim drops every line and attachment in
  lock-step. Lines and attachments have no meaning independent of
  their parent: an orphan line is a free-floating number with no
  currency context, an orphan attachment is a dangling blob ref.
  Domain-layer deletion of a ``draft`` claim is the normal path;
  ``submitted``-or-later rows should never be hard-deleted (the
  audit trail in :mod:`app.adapters.db.audit` carries the write
  history).
* ``property_id`` stays a plain :class:`str` (soft-ref) — matches
  the sibling ``shift.property_id`` / ``movement.occurrence_id``
  rationale in :mod:`app.adapters.db.time` and
  :mod:`app.adapters.db.inventory`. The §05 /
  ``property_workspace`` intersection owns when that becomes a
  hard FK.
* ``decided_by`` is a plain :class:`str` soft-ref — matches the
  sibling ``leave.decided_by`` / ``shift.approved_by`` pattern. The
  approver may be a system process (an agent capability) rather
  than a user; audit linkage lives in :mod:`app.adapters.db.audit`.
* ``owed_destination_id`` / ``reimbursement_destination_id`` are
  plain :class:`str` soft-refs — the ``payout_destination`` table
  does not exist yet (see §09 §"Payout destinations"). Follow-up
  will promote to FKs once the parent table lands, matching the
  ``work_engagement.pay_destination_id`` / ``reimbursement_destination_id``
  convention.
* ``blob_hash`` on :class:`ExpenseAttachment` is a plain
  :class:`str` soft-ref into blob storage (content-addressed hash).
  §09 §"Model" calls this column ``file_id`` — a hard FK to the
  shared ``file`` table — but that table in §02 §"Shared tables"
  has not landed yet, so the v1 slice lands the same
  ``blob_hash`` convention as the sibling
  :class:`app.adapters.db.tasks.models.Evidence` and
  ``payslip.pdf_blob_hash`` columns (column rename + FK promotion
  land together in cd-48c1). The same hash can be referenced by
  multiple rows (same receipt re-used across claims), so keeping
  it blob-ref only preserves the content-addressed storage layer's
  dedup.

Allowed enum values — the v1 slice matches the §02 §"Enums" and §09
§"Model" taxonomy:

* ``expense_claim.state`` — ``draft | submitted | approved | rejected
  | reimbursed`` (§02 ``expense_state``). The domain-layer state
  machine gates transitions (draft → submitted → approved →
  reimbursed, or draft → submitted → rejected); this enum only
  clamps legal values at the DB.
* ``expense_claim.category`` — ``supplies | fuel | food | transport
  | maintenance | other`` (§09 §"Model"). The UI surfaces the
  taxonomy verbatim; widening is a one-line CHECK-list change in a
  later migration.
* ``expense_line.source`` — ``ocr | manual`` (§02
  ``expense_line_source``). A line starts as ``ocr`` when the
  ``expenses.autofill`` capability produced it and stays that way
  even after the worker edits fields — see §09 §"LLM accuracy".
  The ``edited_by_user`` provenance bit lands with cd-7rfu.
* ``expense_attachment.kind`` — ``receipt | invoice | other`` (§09
  §"Model"). The ``receipt`` kind is the OCR-target; the richer
  §02 ``asset_document_kind`` taxonomy (which adds ``manual``,
  ``warranty``, etc.) is asset-scoped and does not apply here.

**Deviation from cd-lbn's prose.** The task body describes a two-
table shape (``Expense`` + ``Receipt``). §02 §"Core entities" and
§09 §"Model" record a three-table shape (``expense_claim``,
``expense_line``, ``expense_attachment``) with per-line itemisation
and richer approval / reimbursement snapshots. The spec is
authoritative (per :file:`.claude/agents/coder.md`), so this module
lands the three-table shape and drops two cd-lbn-prose fields that
disagree with it:

* ``reimbursed_via`` (``cash | bank | card | other``) — §09
  replaces this with ``reimbursement_destination_id`` (soft-ref to
  ``payout_destination``) plus the ``owed_destination_id`` snapshot
  pair captured at approval. The payment-channel taxonomy lives on
  the destination row, not the claim.
* ``Receipt.ocr_json`` / ``ocr_confidence`` — §09 records
  ``llm_autofill_json`` on :class:`ExpenseClaim` (claim-scoped, one
  payload per autofill run covering every page), not per-attachment.
  The ``autofill_confidence_overall`` number lives next to it.

See ``docs/specs/02-domain-model.md`` §"Core entities (by
document)" (§09 row), §"Money", §"Enums"; and
``docs/specs/09-time-payroll-expenses.md`` §"Expense claims".

class ExpenseAttachment(Base):
    """A file attached to a claim — receipt photo, invoice PDF, or other.

    An attachment is a soft-ref into blob storage (content-addressed
    ``blob_hash``) plus a ``kind`` enum pinning the type. Multiple
    attachments per claim are legal (multi-page receipt, receipt +
    invoice). Cardinality is 0..N: a claim may be submitted without
    any attachments (the worker entered fields manually) or with
    many (a taxi receipt, the meal receipt, the tip receipt).

    The ``pages`` int is reserved for multi-page PDF attachments —
    §09 §"Model" names it; the v1 slice lands the column as
    nullable since the autofill capability still operates page-by-
    page and the aggregation lands with cd-7rfu. ``blob_hash`` is
    the content-addressed storage pointer (same convention as
    ``evidence.blob_hash`` and ``payslip.pdf_blob_hash``); the
    shared ``file`` table in §02 §"Shared tables" lands in a later
    migration, at which point the soft-ref becomes a real FK.

    The ``(workspace_id, claim_id)`` index powers the "every
    attachment for this claim" read path — the claim detail view
    lists them in upload order.
