"""Self-service schedule aggregator (cd-6uij).

Read-only helper that powers ``GET /me/schedule`` (§12 "Self-service
shortcuts" / §14 "Schedule view"). Walks the §06 availability stack +
the assigned-task table for the caller and projects every row covering
a date window into the wire shape consumed by the worker
``/schedule`` page.

This module is the **single read seam** for the schedule feed. The
HTTP router in :mod:`app.api.v1.me_schedule` is a thin DTO passthrough
that forwards to :func:`aggregate_schedule` and serialises the
:class:`SchedulePayload`.

Public surface:

* **DTOs** — :class:`WeeklySlotView`, :class:`TaskRefView`,
  :class:`PublicHolidayView`, :class:`PendingItems`,
  :class:`SchedulePayload`.
* **Aggregator** — :func:`aggregate_schedule`. Takes a
  :class:`WorkspaceContext` plus optional ``from_date`` / ``to_date``
  (defaults to the §12 ``[today, today+14d]`` window) and returns a
  :class:`SchedulePayload`.

**Self-only by construction.** Every read predicate is keyed on
``ctx.actor_id`` — a worker cannot use this surface to leak another
user's leaves, overrides, or assigned tasks. The router does **not**
expose a ``user_id`` query param: managers wanting cross-user
visibility use the per-resource generic endpoints (`/user_leaves`,
`/user_availability_overrides`, `/tasks?assignee_user_id=…`).

**Approved vs pending.** Per §12 "Self-service shortcuts" the
aggregator returns approved leaves + overrides + holidays inline, and
pending leaves + overrides under :attr:`SchedulePayload.pending` so
the UI can render "pending approval" state without treating a
not-yet-approved row as live in the precedence stack.

**No audit.** Read-only — the aggregator never writes a row. The
:class:`WorkspaceContext` carries the actor id we filter on; no
``write_audit`` call lands.

**Tenancy.** The ORM tenant filter auto-narrows every SELECT in this
module on ``workspace_id``; the aggregator re-asserts the
``workspace_id = ctx.workspace_id`` predicate explicitly as
defence-in-depth (matches the sibling
:mod:`app.domain.identity.user_leaves` /
:mod:`app.domain.identity.user_availability_overrides` shape).

**Holiday country matching is intentionally simple in v1.** The
aggregator returns every :class:`PublicHoliday` whose calendar date
falls in the window, regardless of ``country``. Country narrowing per
the user's primary property requires the Stay/Property join the
``/me/schedule`` page does not yet drive — a follow-up Beads task
lands the country-aware filter once the property timezone surface
catches up. Annual recurrence is also deferred: v1 surfaces the
literal calendar date the row carries, not the recurring anchor.
