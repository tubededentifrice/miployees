"""Post-flight LLM-call recorder (cd-wjpl).

Thin orchestration seam between an LLM-client call site and the
:mod:`app.domain.llm.budget` module. For every call that left the
client, the caller:

1. Pre-flights via :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.check_budget` (not
   owned by this module — the recorder is strictly post-flight).
2. Dispatches the call through its own adapter and waits for a
   response or terminal failure.
3. Calls :func:`record` with the provider's reported metrics, the
   §11 "LLMResult" telemetry (``fallback_attempts``,
   ``finish_reason``), and the §11 "Agent audit trail" attribution
   (delegating user, token id, agent label).

:func:`record` is pure orchestration — it assembles a domain
:class:`~app.domain.llm.budget.LlmUsage` from the structured inputs
the caller already has, delegates to
:func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.record_usage`, and returns a
:class:`RecordedCall` carrying the correlation id back to the caller
for the ``X-Correlation-Id-Echo`` header round-trip (§11 "Client
abstraction").

What this module is NOT:

* NOT a client wrapper — it doesn't own the HTTP round-trip, retry
  loop, or fallback-chain walk. Those live in the LLM adapter
  (:mod:`app.adapters.llm.openrouter` and siblings) and the
  eventual client abstraction (§11 "Client abstraction").
* NOT a budget pre-flight — callers call
  :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.check_budget` directly before
  dispatch and log ``llm.budget_exceeded`` themselves on refusal.
  A refused call MUST NOT reach :func:`record`; the defensive
  ``status="refused"`` branch in
  :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.record_usage` catches the bypass
  but the recorder treats it as an invariant violation worth
  flagging (see ``test_refused_status_is_defensive`` in the test
  module).
* NOT an audit writer — the caller that triggered the LLM call
  (agent action middleware, digest worker) writes the single
  :class:`~app.adapters.db.audit.models.AuditLog` row per §11
  "Agent audit trail". Writing one here would double-count.

Terminal-error semantic:

* ``status="ok"`` — successful dispatch. The row writes with cost,
  tokens, latency, ``finish_reason``; the ledger bumps by
  ``cost_cents``.
* ``status="error"`` / ``status="timeout"`` — terminal failure
  after the chain exhausted. The row still writes (for the
  /admin/usage feed's "calls that were attempted"). Callers MUST
  pass ``cost_cents=0`` — the invariant is enforced by
  :class:`~app.domain.llm.budget.LlmUsage`'s ``__post_init__``
  (raises :class:`ValueError` on construction if a non-zero cost
  is paired with a non-``"ok"`` status). §11 "Cost tracking" never
  bills a provider failure against the meter; the ledger would
  otherwise inflate silently because
  :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.record_usage` bumps unconditionally
  on non-refused statuses.
* ``status="refused"`` — MUST NOT reach this function. Callers
  catch :class:`BudgetExceeded` out of
  :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.check_budget` and log
  ``llm.budget_exceeded`` themselves (§11 "At-cap behaviour"). The
  defensive branch in ``record_usage`` short-circuits so a bypass
  doesn't destabilise the session. A refusal row built with a
  non-zero cost would ALSO trip the ``LlmUsage`` invariant — the
  refusal bypass is a no-op either way.

See ``docs/specs/11-llm-and-agents.md`` §"Client abstraction",
§"Cost tracking", §"Cost tracking — extended", §"Agent audit trail",
§"Failure modes"; ``docs/specs/02-domain-model.md`` §"LLM"

    """§11 "Agent audit trail" fields the recorder persists verbatim.

    Populated by the API layer from the authenticated request (token
    kind, delegating user, ``X-Agent-Conversation-Ref``) and passed
    opaquely through the recorder. Every field is optional — a
    passkey-session call fills only ``actor_user_id``, a
    service-initiated call (digest worker, health check) fills
    nothing, a delegated-token call fills all four.

    Kept as a frozen dataclass (not a TypedDict) so the type checker
    catches a caller that omits a field rather than silently landing
    ``None`` for a required actor. Slotted so the value can be
    stashed on a request-local record without the dict overhead.

    ``agent_conversation_ref`` is accepted for surface parity with
    §11 "Agent audit trail" but is NOT written to the ``llm_usage``
    row — it lands on the paired ``audit_log`` row the action caller
    writes. The field is carried here so a future extension that
    denormalises the ref onto ``llm_usage`` (for
    correlation-agnostic /admin/usage lookups) has a seat in the
    attribution surface already.

    Empty-string / ``None`` convention: every string field is
    normalised to ``None`` at construction if the caller passes an
    empty string. The DB contract (§02 ``audit_log`` /
    ``llm_usage``) uses ``NULL`` as the "absent" sentinel; an empty
    string that sneaked through would show up as ``""`` on a
    /admin/usage readout and an operator would see a "call with
    empty label" that is just a caller-side typo. Mirrors the
    resolver-bypass coercion on :class:`~app.domain.llm.budget.

    Takes the structured inputs the callers already have (the
    resolved :class:`~app.domain.llm.router.ModelPick`, the
    provider's reported token counts + latency, the §11 agent-audit
    attribution) and builds a domain
    :class:`~app.domain.llm.budget.LlmUsage`. Delegates the actual
    INSERT + ledger bump to
    :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.record_usage` so the idempotency +
    refusal + row-locked ledger-bump semantics stay in one place.

    Caller contract:

    * Call :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.check_budget` **before** the
      provider dispatch. If it raises :class:`BudgetExceeded`, do
      NOT call :func:`record` — the pre-flight path logs
      ``llm.budget_exceeded`` itself and no usage row is written
      (§11 "At-cap behaviour").
    * On success, pass ``status="ok"`` and the provider's
      ``finish_reason``.
    * On terminal failure after the whole chain exhausted, pass
      ``status="error"`` (or ``"timeout"``) with ``cost_cents=0``.
      The /admin/usage feed still sees the attempt without bumping
      the meter. :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.record_usage` bumps
      the ledger unconditionally on non-refused statuses, so
      :class:`~app.domain.llm.budget.LlmUsage` now **enforces**
      ``cost_cents == 0`` when ``status != "ok"`` at construction
      (raises :class:`ValueError`). The §11 "Cost tracking"
      convention is no longer a docstring hope.

    Parameters:

    * ``capability`` — the §11 capability key the caller resolved
      through.
    * ``model_pick`` — head-of-chain rung that actually dispatched.
      For a fallback-success case this is the rung that eventually
      worked; ``fallback_attempts`` carries how many rungs ahead of
      it failed.
    * ``fallback_attempts`` — matches the §11 "LLMResult"
      ``fallback_attempts`` contract. 0 = first-rung success.
    * ``correlation_id`` — tie-id shared across the retry chain and
      echoed back to the caller.
    * ``prompt_tokens`` / ``completion_tokens`` / ``cost_cents`` /
      ``latency_ms`` — provider-reported metrics. ``cost_cents`` is
      already cent-rounded; callers use
      :func:`~app.domain.llm.budget.estimate_cost_cents` on the
      actual (not estimated) token counts.
    * ``status`` — ``"ok" | "error" | "timeout"``. ``"refused"`` is
      rejected via the defensive branch in ``record_usage``; the
      /admin/usage feed never carries refusal rows.
    * ``finish_reason`` — the provider's verbatim string. NULL on
      timeout / transport error.
    * ``attribution`` — §11 "Agent audit trail" fields.
    * ``attempt`` — retry index within one ``(workspace_id,
      correlation_id)`` operation. Defaults to 0; the caller bumps
      this on each rung so the idempotency unique catches a replay.
    * ``clock`` — test seam for deterministic ``created_at``.

    Returns a :class:`RecordedCall` carrying the usage + correlation
    id. No I/O beyond the delegated ``record_usage`` write.
